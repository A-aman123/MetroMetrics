# MetroMetrics: Analyzing Delhi Metro Transit Patterns

## Overview
MetroMetrics is a comprehensive data analysis project focused on the Delhi Metro transit system. This project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Folium to provide insights into metro usage patterns, route popularity, and stop frequency. By visualizing trip data, we aim to understand commuter behavior and identify peak travel times, which can help in improving the efficiency of the metro system.

## Introduction
The Delhi Metro is one of the largest metro networks in the world, serving millions of passengers daily. Analyzing the usage patterns of this transit system is crucial for urban planning and operational efficiency. This project analyzes a dataset containing trip records, focusing on various aspects of metro travel.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about metro trips, including:
- Trip start and end times
- Route information
- Stops and their geographical coordinates

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn folium
```

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MetroMetrics.git
cd MetroMetrics
jupyter notebook
```

## Analysis Overview
The analysis includes the following key components:
1. **Geographical Visualization**: Mapping the metro routes to visualize the geographical spread.
2. **Trip Distribution**: Analyzing the number of trips by day of the week.
3. **Stop Frequency**: Examining the distribution of metro stops and the number of routes passing through each stop.
4. **Time Interval Analysis**: Analyzing trip intervals during different times of the day.

## Visualizations
The project contains various visualizations, including:
- Heatmaps of trip frequencies
- Bar charts of trip counts by day of the week
- Maps showing metro routes and stops

## Conclusion
MetroMetrics provides valuable insights into the Delhi Metro's operational patterns, which can aid in enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. Future work could involve machine learning models to predict travel demand and identify trends over time.
